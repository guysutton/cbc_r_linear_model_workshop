# Linear modelling workshop

In 2020, I delivered a 3-day workshop - 'Introduction to linear models in R' - to a number of post-graduate students and staff members at the Center for Biological Control at Rhodes University in South Africa. The workshop is intended for ecologists who have little to no experience with `R`.

### Topics covered 

#### Statistical tests 

- Linear regression
- Analysis of variance (one-way)
- Analysis of co-variance (ancova)
- General linear models
  - Poisson GLM (count data)
  - Binomial GLM (binary data)

#### Statistical techniques

- Data cleaning 
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Model building
- Model diagnostics/validation
